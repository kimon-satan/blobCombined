Logicise states vs reactions ... ensure mins and maxes
Get growth and start of graphics right
Do explosion / splat part


Work out how to procedurally produce states with reddish color palette
Procedural end variations ... how to manage progression (later)

//NEXT

Jump to granular section ... 
How to indicate motion / start with a grid
Workout how to record and render branches moving on mobile screen

//FINAL Outcome

- basic intro (sounds will probably be a bit static)
- explosions & main screen
- congealing into avatars (might all look the same)
- creating branches (probably no background rendered)
- eating branches (with misty mashup)
